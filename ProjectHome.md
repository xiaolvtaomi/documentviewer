This project provides a light weight, no plugin, document viewer that can run in any browser like IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc or any device like iPad, Android, Blackberry etc.
The document viewer is built in pure HTML and does not require flash or any other installs on client machine.

The document viewer component can display documents as images and allows for lazy loading of documents, thereby following the elastic viewing concept - show to users what they are seeing and not above or below content.
